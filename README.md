### How do I get set up? 

## Quick LaTeX Guide for Suraj 
- Percent signs (%) mark comments. To get a percent sign, escape it by putting a backslash in front.
- & is another special character in LaTeX. Use \& to get &.
- No need to "Compile PDF", but you may do so.
- Note that each part of the document is in a separate file (so we can edit in parallel).
- You may want to "allow pop-ups" for this site, as the compiled PDF will be shown as one.
- If you go to activist_directors.Rnw and "Compile PDF", the full document will be produced.
- Citations are automatic with the correct key. If you want to add cite, just add them in the normal way and I will fill them in.
- You may see "failed" messages and bold question marks where cites are meant to be. Don't worry, these should disappear when we compile the full document.
- Perhaps flag cites that you add with %%%% on the line before or on the same line after the cite.
- LaTeX doesn't pay attention to multiple spaces. Also adjacent lines get collapsed into single paragraphs.
- Insert a blank line between lines that are part of two separate paragraphs.
- \section, \subsection, and \subsubsection have the obvious meanings.
- Note that there is a file papers.bib in the list of files to the right that this pulls bibliographic information
from.
