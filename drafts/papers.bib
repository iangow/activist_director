annote = {CLSTRi We attempt to mitigate the effects of intertemporal correlations using direct and indirect approaches. As a direct approach we use the panel data, but correct the standard errors by clustering techniques. Clustering has the effect of creating a ``super observation'' which reduces the effects of intertemporal correlations on estimated standard errors. All results present t-statistics based on clustered standard errors. As an indirect approach we estimate our models by year. Although this approach mitigates the effects of intertemporal correlations (as each firm only appears once), it also has the effect of ignoring economically genuine across time effects. We choose to present our panel results. Untabulated yearly analysis confirms these results with few modifications. In some years some of the variables were not statistically significant, although there was no pattern and in no case was there more than 2 years of statistically insignificant variables for any coefficient for any year. In no case were the signs of any of the coefficients in the annual regressions different than those obtained in the panel analysis.}

"To control for the dependence in the error terms in our pooled timeseries cross-sectional regression, we use robust standard errors clustered by country and industry (Petersen, 2004; Wooldridge, 2002)." They provide a good reference for the "small-sample" issue, but I'm not sure that our simulation directly addresses the "few clusters, many firms within each" issue they specifically mention. I will look at the Wooldridge references to see if they are smoking crack. If N=500, T=10 produces better results from N=200, T=10, then I think we can address this "few clusters, many firms within each" issue by saying that we don't see it (also, if this exact point is not in Wooldridge, we can say that too). Note that later on they reveal some ignorance in text that suggests (quite clearly if you think about it) that they are clustering by the intersection cluster "better captures" the correlation. The critical fact is that they then assume that errors are independent within industry, across countries and within country, across industries. Our regression analysis adjusts for possible dependence among the residuals by using robust standard errors clustered by country and industry. While an alternative approach would be to use robust standard errors clustered by country alone, Wooldridge (2002, 2003) points out that the clustered standard errors approach is not appropriate when the number of clusters is small relative to the number of observations in each cluster. Since clustering by country would give us only 36 clusters (where each country is a cluster) and hundreds or thousands of observations in each cluster (where each firm is an observation), clustering by country is clearly inappropriate for our analysis.* * We also expect the correlation among residuals to be better captured by country-industry clusters than by country clusters alone, because analysts are often country-industry experts, suggesting a higher correlation across country-industries than across countries. Consistent with this expectation, we find that the intra-cluster correlation among residuals is 0.08 among countryindustry clusters versus 0.05 among country clusters, suggesting country-industry clusters better capture the correlation among the residuals in our analysis.}

We calculate t-statistics using the Newey-West approach. This procedure corrects for heteroskedasticity and both within- and between-firm serial correlations. The significance levels of the results are similar to those reported in table 5. We also estimate the model using firm-fixed effects and obtain similar results. Because penalty varies only by year and we assign a value to penalty each year, the main effect of penalty captures the year-fixed effect.}

annote = {FMNW Because our sample contains multiple observations for each analyst, we estimate equation (1) using four approaches to control for the resulting cross-sectional dependence (see Gleason and Lee [2003], Keane and Runkle [1998]). The first approach (full sample -- A) uses all 20,134 observations in the estimation, but calculates the t-statistics using the Huber-White estimator (White [1980], Huber [1967]). In this computation, cross-sectional dependence is addressed by combining individual revisions for the same firm in estimating the variance--covariance matrix. The second approach (full sample -- B) also uses all 20,134 observations in the estimation, but uses the generalized method-of-moments (GMM) estimator developed by Keane and Runkle [1998] to adjust the standard errors for both aggregate and firm-specific shocks. The third approach (nonoverlapping sample) uses only those 15,461 observations that have no other forecast revisions for the firm occurring during the return accumulation period, thereby eliminating cross-sectional dependence arising from overlapping return windows. The fourth approach (monthly regressions) estimates equation (1) separately for each month using only one observation for each analyst (see Fama and MacBeth [1973]). We examine the time-series averages of the individual coefficient estimates from the 36 monthly cross-sectional regressions. The t-statistics are based on time-series standard errors using the Newey and West [1987] approach to address potential serial correlation in the coefficient estimates from the individual monthly regressions.}

annote = {FMt, test for autocorrelation 4.1. Test for autocorrelation The Fama--MacBeth procedure that we use to analyze the results from estimating Eq. (2) assumes that the ten annual coefficient estimates for each independent variable in Eq. (2) are independent across years. To account for any across-time dependence in the ten estimates of Eq. (2), we could, for each independent variable, adjust the standard error of the mean estimated coefficient for the sample autocorrelation of the ten estimated coefficients. However, this adjustment procedure would be very imprecise because the calculation of the sample autocorrelation would be based on a time series of only ten observations. As stated by Fama and French (1998, p. 826), ``with such imprecision, the formal cure for autocorrelation can be worse than the disease''. Given the imprecision of formally adjusting for the autocorrelation of the ten estimated coefficients for each independent variable, we do not make such an adjustment. However, we do test the extent to which our data suffer from an autocorrelation problem as follows. First, we pool all 20,877 firm-year observations and use the pooled data to estimate Eq. (2). We refer to the resulting regression residual for firm i in year t as uit. Next, we identify the 15,536 firm-years in the pooled data for which a given firm i appears in the data in both year t{\textminus}1 and year t and form a dataset that contains uit for each of these 15,536 firm-years. Last, we use this dataset to estimate a model of the relationship that would exist between a firm's regression residuals in year t{\textminus}1 and year t if the underlying data-generating process is an AR(1) process (i.e., a first-order autoregressive process). The model that we estimate is as follows: uit=$\rho$uit{\textminus}1+var epsilonit, (4) where the subscript i refers to firm i and the subscript t refers to year t (t=1990, {\ldots}, 1998); and u is the firm-year-specific regression residual that is obtained when all 20,877 firm-year observations are pooled and then used to estimate Eq. (2). If the $\rho$ estimate in Eq. (4) is large, then we may have an autocorrelation problem in the data. When we estimate Eq. (4), the resulting $\rho$ estimate is equal to 0.0065 (t=0.82). This small $\rho$ estimate suggests that it is reasonable to assume that there is little autocorrelation in our data, which in turn suggests that it is reasonable to treat the ten annual estimates of Eq. (2) as independent across years. , 13}

Also, throughout the paper, our conclusions about the effect of family firm membership are robust to outlier deletions as well as the use of binary transformation of control variables. Finally for all the models in the paper, we carry out year-by-year estimations. We find that the year-by-year coefficients in most cases have signs consistent with that reported for the pooled regression. In the few cases where the signs are not consistent, the coefficients are never statistically significant.We also compute Z1, where t is t-statistic, k is the degrees of freedom for year j, and N is the number of years. This statistic controls for the effect of time-series correlation of the variables. Our conclusions remain unaffected.}
