\section{Activist directors} \label{sect:act_directors}

\subsection{Descriptive statistics}

Table \ref{tbl:dir_chars} provides descriptive statistics for our sample of directors.
Because we focus our analysis on activist directors in their first year, the appropriate comparison groups comprise directors in their first year on their respective boards.
Of the 594,300 observations (director-firm-years) in our sample, 56,455 relate to new directors where there was no activism targeting the firm in the year of appointment.
The average age of these directors is 62.70, 14\% of them are female, 73\% are appointed to committees in their first year, and 16\% are denoted as audit committee financial experts.\footnote{SEC rules require a company to disclose whether it has at least one ``audit committee financial expert'' serving on its audit committee, and if so, the name of the expert and whether the expert is independent of management.
See \url{http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-8177.htm}.}
Additional 1,560 observations relate to new directors where there was activist targeting the firm in the year of appointment, but board seats were not demanded by, nor granted to, activists.
The average age of these directors is 61.15, 14\% of them are female, 73\% are appointed to committees in their first year, and 17\% are denoted as audit committee financial experts.
These directors share the same chracteristics as other new directors.

We identify 809 activist directors (of our full sample of \Sexpr{dirs$all_dirs}) on Equilar; we find that some activist directors leave within a year (e.g., if the firm is acquired or the director leaves the board in a short period of time) and Equilar appears not to capture most such directors, as they often do not appear in the proxy statement (DEF 14A), which is the primary source for Equilar's data.
% Actually some of the 678 directors were categorized as "activism" or "board demand" depending on when they were appointed as directors.

In general, unaffiliated directors are similar to other new directors on most dimensions except that there is a noticeably smaller number who are female ($0.06$ versus $0.14$).
However, affiliated directors (i.e., employees or principals of members of the activist group) appear different: they are younger (52 years of age), rarely female (just \emph{1\%} of affiliated activist directors are women).
While activist directors appear more likely to become members of the compensation committee in their first year of service ($0.40$ versus $0.34$ for directors not associated with activism campaigns), they are less frequently added to the audit committee ($0.33$), especially affiliated directors ($0.25$), than non-activism new directors ($0.41$).

Panel B of Table \ref{tbl:dir_chars} presents data on the tenure of activist directors.
About $\Sexpr{prettyNum((378+243)/(973+650)*100, digits = 2)}\%$ of activist directors remain on their respective boards at the time of December 31, 2017.
Affiliated (unaffiliated) directors who have left their respective boards, did so after being on the board for 616 (626) days in median (i.e., they remained on the board for 1.7 years).
% \footnote{These numbers give the mean tenure statistics \emph{without} accounting for censoring.}
In many cases, their departure was associated with the company being acquired, going private, or going bankrupt.
Affiliated and unaffiliated activist directors who remain on their respective boards as of December 31, 2017 have median tenures of 3.2 years.

\subsection{Director elections: Voting outcomes}
In this section, we examine voting outcomes for activist directors.
Voting in director elections provides a mechanism for shareholders to communicate their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with directors' performance.
We examine whether activist directors are regarded differently by shareholders by looking at voting outcomes in director elections upon or following appointment.
Table 4 provides results from OLS regressions where the dependent variable is \textit{Support}, the percentage of votes for the director based on data from ISS Voting Analytics.
To control for the various factors affecting shareholder support for directors at the time of the meeting, we include meeting fixed effects.
Thus this analysis compares voting outcomes for activist directors with those of other directors at the same firm who are up for election at the same shareholder meeting.
Columns 1 and 2 provide results for each activist director's first election (excluding contested elections) while columns 3 and 4 (5 and 6) provide results for second (third) elections.

The results in Column 1 show that activist directors get significantly higher shareholder support than other directors: $3.497$ ($3.045$) percentage points higher in the case of unaffiliated (affiliated) activist directors.
These apparent effects are non-trivial: the inter-quartile range of voting support in our sample is $7.24\%$ and the within-meeting standard deviation is $6.77\%$.
Because ISS recommendations are understood to affect shareholder votes, we include an indicator for a favorable recommendation from ISS for each director in the regression reported in Column 2.
The estimated coefficient of $16.964\%$ is consistent with ISS having a significant effect on vote outcomes.
However, even controlling for ISS recommendations, there is greater shareholder support for both unaffiliated and affiliated directors: $2.576$ ($2.141$) percentage points higher in the case of unaffiliated (affiliated) activist directors.\footnote{ISS policies explicitly reflect the preferences of institutional investor clients, so ISS recommendations are plausibly codetermined with vote outcomes.
So inclusion of the ISS indicator plausibly provides a downwardly biased estimate of shareholder support for activist directors.}

However, elevated shareholder support for activist directors is short-lived and the shareholders consider the activist directors as the same as other directors in subsequent elections. Shareholder support for activist directors is generally statistically indistinguishable from that of other directors one (Columns 3 and 4) and two (Columns 5 and 6) years following activism.
This is consistent wtih shareholders assessing directors' performance in the same way regardless of how they became a director.

\subsection{Career outcomes} \label{sect:career}
In this section, we examine the career outcomes of activist directors following their appointment.
It is possible that those directors appointed by or recruited by activist hedge funds may have different career outcomes from other directors.
For example, in the case of unaffiliated activist directors, their experience might lead to more directorships in other companies in the future.
Or being an activist director may ``taint'' a director and lead to fewer directorships.
Table \ref{tbl:career} provides results from OLS regressions where the dependent variables are the number of board seats in other companies between one ($\textit{Other boards}_{t+1}$) and four ($\textit{Other boards}_{t+4}$) years after activism.
In contrast, any ``taint'' that affiliated activist directors might experience more plausibly stems from being directly affiliated with the activist firm than from being an activist director.
And future directorships likely stem from activism events engaged in by their affiliated firm where board seats are won.
For these reasons, we examine affiliated and unaffiliated activist directors separately.

We find that one and two years after appointment, affiliated directors have a higher number of other directorships (0.333 more in $t+2$, controlling for other factors).
Additionally, we find that the unaffiliated directors also have 0.114 to 0.136 more other directorships in three or four years after their appointment, respectively, (see Columns 3 and 4).
This appears consistent with unaffiliated activist directors having positive career effects from becoming an activist director.
The two-year delay may stem from the limited ability of directors to add board seats in the short run given concerns about ``busy'' directors.

\section{Activist target selection} \label{sect:selection}
Prior research suggests that hedge fund activists typically target smaller firms, value-oriented firms (low market-to-book), and firms with sound operating cash flows but low sales growth, leverage and dividend payouts \citep*{Brav:2010gx}.
We apply this analysis to our sample and examine whether the factors that are associated with activists seeking, or getting, board representation differ from those associated with activism in general.

We first examine the circumstances in which firms find themselves as the targets of activists.
Panel A of Table \ref{tbl:selection} reports the results of logistic regressions where the dependent variables are indicators for activism and the sample is the universe of firm-years meeting our sample requirements for the years 2004 to 2016.
The first column looks at the probability of being targeted for any kind of activism event, the second column examines the determinants of an activist making demands for board representation, and the third column examines the determinants of an activist getting representation on a firm's board.\footnote{Note that, in contrast to our other analyses, for the purpose of this table, our activism indicators are \emph{not} mutually exclusive.
That is, \textit{Activism} includes cases in any of the categories \textit{Non-board activism}, \textit{Board demand}, and \textit{Activist director}, while \textit{Board demand} includes cases of \textit{Activist director}, as well as cases where the board demands are not successful}.
Focusing on Column 1 of Panel A, we find that book-to-market is positively associated with activism, consistent with prior research \citep{Brav:2008eu} that find activists targeting undervalued firms.
Also, we find that size-adjusted return is negatively associated with being targeted by activists, consistent with activists targeting poorly performing firms.
In addition, consistent with prior research, we find that smaller companies are more likely to be targeted.
However, the positive association between the proportion of directors who are independent (\textit{Outside percent}) and activism is more difficult to explain in the same way, as this measure is suggested by some to be a proxy for \emph{good} governance \citep{Bhagat:2008jc}.
One possible explanation is that a more independent board makes a firm more receptive to proposals from activists.

Turning to Column 2 of Panel A of Table \ref{tbl:selection}, we see evidence that activists are more likely to target a firm with demands for board representation when a greater portion of the firm's shares are held by institutional investors, consistent with these investors being more open to supporting activists.
Smaller firms are also more likely to be the target for board-related activism. In addition, we find that the board size is associated with the likelihood of being asked for board representation, consistent with the number of directors being a proxy for poor governance and activists targeting firms with worse governance \citep{Yermack:1996wv}.

In Column 3 of Panel A, we additionally find that activists are more likely to gain a board seat when the payout is lower, the institutional holding is higher, return is lower, the firm is smaler, the book-to-market ratio is higher, and the board size is bigger with a higher number of outside directors. We examine whether these activist directors are more or less likely to be affilaited with activists in our next analysis in Panel B.

In Panel B of Table \ref{tbl:selection}, we focus on activism events in examining two questions.
First, given that a firm has been targeted by activists, what are the factors that are associated with the activist demanding board seats?
Second, given that a firm has been targets by activists, what factors are associated with the activist's demands being met with board appointments, either of affiliated or unaffiliated activist directors.

We find evidence that conditional on selecting a firm as a target, an activist is more likely to demand board representation when the firm is smaller, has performed worse, has higher institutional holdings, and has more outside directors.
In the second column, we see that performance, payout, and number of directors are all associated with getting an activist director on the board.
Again, activists are more likely to get board representation at firms with more directors, consistent with activists being more inclined to seek and get board representation at firms with worse governance \citep{Yermack:1996wv}.
We also see evidence that activists are more likely to get board representation when targeting firms with greater portion of their shares held by institutional investors, consistent with these investors being more open to supporting activist candidates.
In the last column, where we focus on the affiliated directors, we additionally see that payout is one of the most significant factors associated with having an activist director who is directly affiliated with the activist hedge fund.
We later examine whether the activist director appointments, especiallly the affiliated directors, is followed by increases in payout.

\section{Activist holding periods} \label{sect:holding}
We next examine whether having an activist director is associated with the length of time the activist holds the stock.
Many argue that activist shareholders are opportunists only investing for a short period of time and leave.
Thus, it is important to examine their actual holding period and how it changes when there exists activist directors on board.
We examine three holding periods: \textit{Entry--Exit}, which runs from the first date on which the stock was held to the last date the stock was held; \textit{Annc--Exit}, which runs from the date on which activism was first announced (typically with a 13D filing) to exit; and \textit{Appt--exit}, which runs from the first appointment of an activist director through to the date of exit.\footnote{We measure the exit date as the record date of the first 13F filing in which the stock is no longer part of the activist's portfolio.}
Because we use 13F filing data to determine when an activist acquires and disposes of stock and 13F filings are quarterly, our measures of holding period (expressed in days) have some measurement error.

Another issue with measuring holding periods is that censoring is significant in our sample.
Many of the activism campaigns in our sample are recent and the activist continues to hold stock at the time we measure the holding period.
Thus, to estimate the association between activism category and holding period, we use censored median regression \citep{Portnoy:2003wp}.
Table \ref{tbl:holdings} presents these results.
When there are activist directors affiliated with the activist hedge fund, we find a highly significant incremental holding period of 366 days from entry to exit and 582 days from announcement of activism to exit relative to activism without activist directors.\footnote{This is consistent with \textit{Affiliated director} having a shorter period from entry to announcement of activism.}
However, we find smaller difference with \textit{Unaffiliated director} cases.\footnote{This is potentially associated with \textit{Unaffiliated director} cases having a higher likelihood of the target firm being acquired; see Table \ref{tbl:div_acq}.}
While the estimated median holding period for other activism events is 790 days (i.e., about 2.2 years), the equivalent for \textit{Unaffiliated director} events is 882 days (i.e., about 2.4 years) and that for \textit{Affiliated director} events is 1,156 days (i.e., about 3.1 years).
The results suggest that activists would invest in the company for almost one more year if there is an affiliated director on the board.
From announcement to exit, \textit{Affiliated director} activists hold the stock for 1,002 days (2.7 years) and for 744 days (2.0 years) from the first appointment of an activist director.

To put these statistics into perspective, it is helpful to consider some benchmarks.
\citet{Cremers:2013vt} examine the holding period of various kinds of investors.
They examine four categories of investors (banks, pension funds, investment companies, and others) and find that pension funds have the longest duration at 2 years.
They also examine the holdings of some institutional investors and provide only one example of an investor with a duration greater than three years, namely the well-known long-term investor, Berkshire Hathaway, which had a duration of between 3 and 4 years during our sample period.
Another reference point is provided by the \citet{Beyer:2014niri} survey of investor relation professionals, who consider $2.8$ years as a cutoff beyond which investors can be considered ``long-term'' investors.
These benchmarks suggest the holding period of activists getting representation on boards provides them with a relatively long investment horizon.

\section{Stock returns} \label{sect:returns}
We follow prior research in examining the impact of activism on stock returns and examine whether stock market reactions to activism differ by the three categories of activism: \textit{Activism}, \textit{Affiliated director}, and \textit{Unaffiliated director}.
We begin by looking at short-window returns around the announcement of activism using a window beginning 1 day before and ending 1 day after the announcement of activism.
For these short-window tests, we consider raw, market-adjusted, and size-adjusted returns ($R$, $R^{MKT}$, and $R^{SZ}$, respectively).
Results are reported in Panel A of Table \ref{tbl:returns}.
Consistent with prior research, \citep{Brav:2008eu}, we find significant announcement-period returns for activism events, with market-adjusted returns ranging from 3\% to 4\% for the three categories.
Note that at the time of the announcement of activism, the market would not know which category the activism would ultimately fall into.
We get very similar results when we consider returns windows such as $(-10, +10)$ days.

In Panel B of Table \ref{tbl:returns}, we examine the market reaction around the settlement of activism events.
Many activism campaigns end up in settlement, and its announcement return can show the investors' expectation and satisfaction with the settlement results.
For 662 settlement cases we could identify, we find a positive and significant market reaction around the settlement dates, especially for the activist director (\textit{Affiliated director} and \textit{Unaffiliated director}) cases.
It suggests that investors may have higher hopes for those cases where activist directors are appointed or nominated as a result of the settlement between the management and the activist.

In Panel C of Table \ref{tbl:returns}, we examine the market reaction around the appointment of activist director.
We also find a positive and significant market reaction around this date, and the positive returns for \textit{Affiliated director} is slightly higher, suggesting that investors may have higher expectation with the hedge fund affiliated directors.

In Panel D of Table \ref{tbl:returns}, we examine returns over the 12-month and 24-month periods from the appointment of activist directors.
% Due to the greater importance of controlling for risk over longer periods, we also consider Fama-French abnormal returns, using both equal-weighted and value-weighted returns for the associated benchmark portfolios.
We do not find positive returns for both \textit{Affiliated director} and \textit{Unaffiliated director}, which are in contrast to the short-term results.
One issue with interpreting the returns for the activist director cases is that the director appointments generally occur well after the announcement of activism events.
% Thus we consider longer-window returns for activist director cases beginning from the appointment of these directors to the board.
% Results are reported in Panels E (12-month returns) and F (36-month returns) of Table \ref{tbl:returns}.
% In general, we do not find non-zero risk-adjusted returns over either period for either category.

\section{Firm outcomes} \label{sect:outcomes}
While stock market reaction provides a useful measure for evaluating the impact of activists, it is not without issues.
First, we need to identify the time at which the market learned about the prospect of activist involvement.
Second, we need the market to estimate the impact of activism in an unbiased manner and impound this estimate into price promptly.
Finally, even if these difficulties are addressed, the stock market reaction does not provide insight into \emph{how} activists affect corporate policy and firm value.

In this section, we examine the impact of activists, especially activist directors, on a number of outcomes, with a focus on outcomes that are commonly sought by activists.

\subsection{Profitability} \label{sect:roa}
We first examine the association between activism and operating performance.
Our empirical approach follows that of \citet{Bebchuk:2013wi}, which is a modification of the approach used in \citet{Brav:2008eu}.
Thus we measure operating performance as return on assets calculated as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (Compustat item \texttt{oibdp}) divided by lagged total assets (\texttt{at}).
For each firm-year $t$, we construct indicators for activism in year $t + s$ where $s \in \{-3, \dots, +5\}$, where, for example, $\textit{Activist}_{t-3}$ takes the value $1$ for $t=2004$ and a given firm if an activism campaign began in 2007.

We estimate three models.
Following \citet{Bebchuk:2013wi}, all models include year fixed effects, market value, and firm age, and indicators for activism.
Following \citet{Bebchuk:2013wi}, models (A) and (B) add industry and firm fixed effects, respectively.
To examine a possible \emph{incremental} effect of an activist getting board representation, Model (C) refines model (B) by including indicators for activist director appointments in years ranging from three years prior ($\textit{Affilaited director}_{t-3}$ and $\textit{Unaffilaited director}_{t-3}$) to five years subsequent ($\textit{Affiliated director}_{t+5}$ and $\textit{Unaffiliated director}_{t+5}$).

Table \ref{tbl:roa} presents results.
The numbers presented in the table represent estimates of the impact of activism and activist directors, and are calculated as the difference between the estimated coefficients on the respective activism indicators for years $t+s$ and $t$, where $s \in \{1, \dots, 5\}$.
In both models (A) with industry fixed effects and in models (B) and (C) with firm fixed effects, we find statistically significant increases in \textit{ROA} in all five years.
These effects are economically significant, with the five-year increase in \textit{ROA} exceeding $2.1\%$ in both models.

Looking at the incremental effect of getting an affiliated or an unaffiliated director on the board, we mostly do not detect a statistically significant effect; the incremental effects are statistically indistinguishable from zero.
If an incremental effect does exist, our failure to detect it statistically may be attributed to multicollinearity between our activism indicators (in many cases, the activist director is appointed in the same year that the activist campaign commences) and a lack of power stemming from a smaller number of observations.
However, we find weakly significant results for affiliated directors in $\textit{ROA}_{t+3} - \textit{ROA}_{t}$ and $\textit{ROA}_{t+4} - \textit{ROA}_{t}$, suggesting higher long-term operating performance with affiliated directors on board beyond the baseline effect of activist invervention.

Having demonstrated an effect of activism on operating performance, we next turn to a range of other outcomes that activists often seek to influence more directly.
The examples discussed above in Section \ref{sect:lit_review} suggest that activists often seek to influence corporate policy or decisions on a wide range of matters.
They include matters related to mergers and acquisitions (including divestitures of businesses), CEO turnover and compensation, capital structure (including cash holdings and dividend payout), and investment policy.

\subsection{Divestiture and acquisitions} \label{sect:div_acq}
The first set of outcomes we examine relate to mergers and acquisitions.
The examples discussed above suggest that one concern activists have is with excessive spending on acquisitions by target firms.
Thus, the first outcome we consider is \textit{Acquisition}, an indicator for whether the firm completed any acquisitions in the two years after a given fiscal year.
\citet{Greenwood:2009kh} suggest that announcement returns associated with activism ``are largely explained by the ability of activists to force target firms into a takeover.'' Thus one outcome we consider, \textit{Acquired}, is an indicator for whether the firm was acquired in the two years after a given fiscal year.
Finally, activists often urge firms to divest businesses.
Thus our third outcome is \textit{Divestiture}, an indicator for whether the firm divested significant assets in the two years after a given fiscal year.
We regress these indicators on industry and year dummies as well as the following controls (as described in Section \ref{sect:desc_stats}), \textit{Analyst}, \textit{Institutional}, \textit{Market value}, \textit{Book-to-market}, \textit{Leverage}, \textit{Payout}, \textit{ROA}, \textit{Sales growth}, \textit{Outside percent}, \textit{Age}, \textit{Tenure}, and \textit{Staggered board}.
% TODO Find out exactly what Divestiture measures.

Table \ref{tbl:div_acq} presents these results.
Examining the first column in Table \ref{tbl:div_acq}, we see the two categories of activism, \textit{Unaffiliated director} and \textit{Other activism}, are associated with lower probability of acquisitions (coefs. $-0.102$ and $-0.036$, respectively).
On the other hand, activism of the forms \textit{Other activism} is positively associated with being acquired (coefs $0.128$), but we do not find evidence when an activist director is appointed (the difference between \textit{Affiliated director} and \textit{Other activism} and the difference between \textit{Unaffiliated director} and \textit{Other activism} are statistically significant at the $1\%$ level).
Finally, divestitures are positively associated with activism whether or not there is an activist director appointment (coefs. $0.062$ to $0.121$).
Overall, we find that having an activist director, whether affiliated or unaffiliated, is associated with higher likelihood of cutting down acquisition activities and increasing divestitures while other activism events result in higher likelihood of selling the business entirely.

\subsection{CEO turnover and compensation} \label{sect:ceo}
We next consider the association of activism with CEO turnover and compensation.
We code the indicator \textit{CEO turnover} equal to $1$ if the CEO at the end of year $t$ is no longer CEO (and the company still exists) in year $t+2$.
For total CEO pay, we regress total CEO compensation in year $t+2$ on controls, including CEO compensation in year $t$, and indicators for each category of activism.
We regress these variables on their lagged (year $t$) values, industry and year dummies, as well as controls used in other regressions (see Section \ref{sect:desc_stats}).

Results of our analysis are presented in Table \ref{tbl:ceo}.
We find positive associations between CEO turnover and both \textit{Affiliated director} (coef. $0.198$, $p < 0.01$) and \textit{Unaffiliated director} (coef. $0.198$, $p < 0.01$).
The coefficient is also positive and significant for \textit{Other activism}.
However, there is no significant difference between the coefficients on \textit{Affiliated director} or \textit{Unaffiliated director} and \textit{Other activism}.
We do not find significant associations between CEO compensation and \textit{Affiliated director}, \textit{Unaffiliated director}, nor \textit{Other activism}.
Overall, while activism events are generally associated with higher likelihood of CEO turnover we do not find evidence that it is incrementally more significant when there are activist directors on board.

\subsection{Capital structure and payouts} \label{sect:financing}

Among the most common demands activists make are requests for firms to reduce cash holdings, to increase leverage, and to increase the payment of dividends or the buybacks.
In Table \ref{table:fin}, we examine the association between activism and measures of cash holding, leverage, and shareholder payout (dividends and share repurchases).
As outcome variables, we consider \textit{Cash}, calculated as the ratio of total cash and short-term investments to the book value of total assets; \textit{Leverage}, measured as the ratio of book value of debt to the sum of the book value of debt and equity; and, \textit{Payout}, measured as the ratio of total dividends and share repurchases to EBITDA for the two years after year $t$.
We regress these variables on their year-$t$ values, industry and year dummies, as well as controls used in other regressions (see Section \ref{sect:desc_stats}).

We find that having an activist director is not significantly associated with reduced cash holdings even though the coefficients are all negative across all categories of activism.
Also, we find that leverage is positively associated with \textit{Affiliated director} (coef. $0.037$, $p < 0.10$) while the coefficients are all positive across all categories of activism.
Additionally, \textit{Affiliated director} (coef. $0.147$, $p < 0.01$) is associated with increased payout.
Here, the difference in coefficient from \textit{Other activism} is positive and significant at 1$\%$, suggesting that affiliated activist director appointment is positively associated with higher payout than had there been no affiliated activist director appointment.
Furthermore, the coefficient for \textit{Affiliated director} is significantly higher than the coefficient for \textit{Unaffiliated director} at 10\%.
It is interesting to notice that the lower level of payout was associated with the higher likelihood of gaining a board seat for activists, especially for \textit{affiliated director}.
Overall, the evidence in Table \ref{table:fin} points to activist directors being associated with the kinds of capital structure and payout changes demands frequently demanded by activists and the effect is especially significant for the level of payout in the case of affiliated directors.

\subsection{Investment} \label{sect:investment}
In this last section, we examine the association between activism and three areas of spending commonly regarded as investment: capital expenditures, research and development (R\&D), and advertising. Anecdotally, we see many activist investors asking for the reduction of such expenditure so we empirically test the effect here.
We measure investment using the following proxies:
\textit{CapEx}, measured as the ratio of capital expenditure for two years after announcement of activism to the lagged book value of total assets;
\textit{R\&D}, measured as the ratio of total R\&D expenditure for two years after announcement of activism to the lagged book value of total assets; and,
\textit{Advertising}, measured as the ratio of advertising expenditure for three years after announcement of activism to the lagged book value of total assets.
We regress these variables on their year-$t$ values, industry and year dummies, as well as controls used in other regressions (see Section \ref{sect:desc_stats}).

Results are presented in Table \ref{tbl:invest}.
We find negative associations between having affiliated activist directors and capital expenditure.
In \textit{Affiliated director} cases, we find significant and negative effects on \textit{CapEx}.
We also find a negative association with \textit{Affiliated director} and R\&D spending (coef. $-0.007$) in addition to \textit{Unaffiliated director} cases (coef. $-0.009$). The differences of coefficients from \textit{Other activism} are significant for both categories.
In the case of advertisement spending, we do not find significant decreases for both \textit{Affiliated director} and \textit{Unaffiliated direcotr} cases.

Overall, the evidence in Table \ref{tbl:invest} is consistent with activist directors playing a significant role in curbing expenditures on capital investment and research and development (R\&D).
However, it is unclear whether this reflects curtailment of excessive investments or, as critics of activists might suggest, underinvestment and a focus on the short term.

Based on the results on acquisitions, capital struecture, and investments above, we conclude that the activist directors are more interested in increasing shareholder value through conducting internal changes in corporate policites; they influence the target companies to take out more debt, cut off R\&D and Capex spending, and push the firms into divestiture, rather than pushing the target firms into an external market and sell as the corporate raiders have done decades ago.
\footnote{We additionally examined whether having two or more activist directors would make a difference and find that CEO is more likely to leave, payout is more likely to increase, and R\&D expense is more likely to decrease following the appointment of two or more \textit{Affiliated directors}.}
